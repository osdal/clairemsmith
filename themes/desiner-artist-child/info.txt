Hello Dmitro,
I have another task. An easy one.
We need a wordpress site created from a psd using a template.



Here is the template:
https://wordpress.org/themes/designer-artist/



Attached is the jpg. I will upload the psd to her sever



JUST A FEW CHANGES ON THE ATTACHED SAMPLE.



Only changes would be:
1. Company name Claire M. Smith Arts (not Claire Smith Arts - ADD MIDDLE INITIAL)
2. Indent the text in the content area so it doesn't go so far across the page
3. We will be changing one picture in the bottom section.
change broken Appreciate picture to hope - WILL GET THE NEW PIC TO YOU
4. correct email address is: clairesmith.12323@yahoo.com (for top and bottom of page)
5. In the footer, where I have a phone number on the right, it should be the email address
6. at the top and in the footer the email and phone number should be corrected.
correct phone number is: 310.463.1007



I sent the theme. And the home page should look EXACTLY like the image I sent.
The child pages, everything will be the same (top banner and footer).
About page will also have the 4 boxes below the top banner. Only text content will be different.
The shop page content area will be blank for now.
The Contact page content will have the 4 boxes below the banner and the text will be:
Please feel free to contact us.
THEN HER EMAIL ADDRESS
THEN HER PHONE NUMBER



Please let me know how much time to do this. I am getting quotes from 3 people. Thank you!!!



If things go well, I wills send you more more! ðŸ™‚
